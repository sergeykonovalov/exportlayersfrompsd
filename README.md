# Export Layers from PSD

Small handy JS code for Adobe Phototshop Creative Cloud to do batch export for layers (or layer groups) as separate images.

Script walks through all available layers (or layer groups), ensures current one is visible, exports as JPEG to the defined path, then sets current one invisible and goes to the next.

## Usage

1. Run Adobe ExtendScript Toolkit CC from Start menu.

2. Choose File > Open and select downloaded exportLayers.jsx.

3. Run the script.
